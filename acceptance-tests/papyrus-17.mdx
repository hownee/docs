## Objective
Ensure that an admin user can add new users to the instance during setup and that those users can log in later.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist or be created.

## Steps
1. Log in to your instance setup page: [https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/setup/*](https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/setup/*)
	- _Screenshot needed: User management page before adding users._
2. Add new users by entering their details (e.g., name, email, role). Please enter the details you used below:

	```
	[Insert user names, emails, and roles here]
	```

3. Save the configuration and wait for the system to process the changes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the user addition process and confirmation message._
4. Verify that the new users are listed and can log in to the instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: User list or login confirmation for new users._

## Expected Results
- New users are added to the instance and can log in successfully.
- If user addition fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
