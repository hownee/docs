## Objective
Ensure that module settings persist after logging out and back in, confirming configuration persistence.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance and module must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus Vitrine Website App as an admin and go to the modules page: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules)
	- _Screenshot needed: Modules page before enabling modules._
2. Enable or configure the desired modules. Please specify the modules and settings below:

	```
	[Insert module names and settings here]
	```

3. Log out of the app.
	- _Screenshot needed: Logout confirmation or login page after logout._
4. Log back in with the same admin account.
	- _Video recommended: Record the logout and login process._
5. Return to the modules page and verify that the previously enabled modules and settings persist.
	- _Screenshot needed: Modules page after re-login, showing settings are retained._

## Expected Results
- Module settings persist after logging out and back in.
- If the settings do not persist, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
