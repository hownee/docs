## Objective
Ensure that an admin user can set the default theme for the instance during setup.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist or be created.

## Steps
1. Log in to your instance setup page: [https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/setup/*](https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/setup/*)
	- _Screenshot needed: Theme selection page before choosing a theme._
2. Select the default theme for the instance. Please specify the theme you selected below:

	```
	[Insert theme name here]
	```

3. Save the configuration and wait for the system to process the changes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the theme selection and confirmation message._
4. Verify that the selected theme is applied to the instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instance dashboard or main page with the new theme applied._

## Expected Results
- The selected theme is applied as the default for the instance.
- If theme selection fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
