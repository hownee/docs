## Objective
Ensure an admin user can create a new instance dynamically and verify its availability.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus app as an admin and navigate to the home section with the instances list: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home)
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page before creation._
2. Click the **Create Instance** button or similar action to start the creation process.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instance creation form or confirmation dialog._
3. Fill in the required details for the new instance (e.g., name, configuration). Please enter the details you used below:

	```
	[Insert instance name here]
	[Insert configuration details here]
	```

4. Confirm and submit the creation request. Note that this process may take up to 5 minutes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the process from creation to instance availability._
5. Once the system responds, check that the new instance appears in the list and is accessible.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page with the new instance visible._

## Expected Results
- The new instance is generated and appears in the list.
- The instance is accessible and functional.
- If creation fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
