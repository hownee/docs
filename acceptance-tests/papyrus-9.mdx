## Objective
Ensure an admin user can remove modules from a configured instance and verify that users can no longer access the removed modules.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance and module must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus Vitrine Website App as an admin and go to the modules page: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules)
	- _Screenshot needed: Modules page before removal._
2. Select the module(s) you wish to remove. Please specify the modules below:

	```
	[Insert module names here]
	```

3. Click the **Remove** or **Delete** button for the selected modules.
	- _Screenshot needed: Removal confirmation dialog or progress indicator._
4. Wait for the system to process the removal. This may take a few minutes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the removal process and confirmation of completion._
5. Log in as a standard user and verify that the removed modules are no longer accessible in the instance app.
	- _Screenshot needed: User view of the instance app after module removal._

## Expected Results
- The selected modules are removed from the instance.
- Standard users can no longer access the removed modules.
- If the removal fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
