## Objective
Ensure that a user (guest or non-admin) can log into an instance and access the appropriate sections.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a guest or non-admin account for testing.
- You must have access to an ATP instance or a personal instance.

## Steps
1. Use the ATP Instance created for your uses or a personal instance created for testing:
   - [https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.papyrus.hownee.com](https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.papyrus.hownee.com)
   - [https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com](https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com)

2. If you have never entered the credentials, you will be redirected to the sign-in page:
   - [https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.papyrus.hownee.com/auth/sign-in](https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.papyrus.hownee.com/auth/sign-in)
   - [https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/auth/sign-in](https://your-instance-name.papyrus.hownee.com/auth/sign-in)
3. Enter your credentials. If using the ATP instance, use the **PAPYRUS_ATP_INSTANCE_ACCESS** credentials. Otherwise, use the credentials you created for your instance.

4. Click the **Login** or **Sign In** button.
5. Observe the system response. If login is successful, you should be redirected to the main dashboard or homepage of the instance.

- The user can access all sections available to their role.
- If login fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
