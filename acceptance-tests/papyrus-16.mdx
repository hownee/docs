	- _Screenshot needed: Module selection page before choosing modules._
2. Select the modules you wish to install for the instance. Please specify the modules below:

	```
	[Insert module names here]
	```

3. Save the configuration and wait for the system to process the changes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the module selection and installation process._
4. Verify that the selected modules are installed and available in the instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: Confirmation page or dashboard with installed modules._

## Expected Results
