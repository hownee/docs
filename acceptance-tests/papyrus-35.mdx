2. Switch the app language to each supported language (e.g., French, English).
3. For each language:

	- Check all static and dynamic content, including buttons, menus, forms, and notifications.
	- Note any untranslated or contextually incorrect text.
	- **Take screenshots** of any issues or of representative pages in each language.
	- **Record a short video** (optional) demonstrating the language switch and navigation.
4. If any user data is displayed (e.g., user profile, personalized content), ensure it is also properly translated. **If needed, insert sample user data and verify translations.**

## Expected Results
- All content is correctly translated without missing or incorrect text.
- No untranslated strings or language artifacts remain.
