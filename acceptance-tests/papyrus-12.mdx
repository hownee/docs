title: "Check Privilege Escalation Protection"
description: "Ensure unauthorized role escalation is prevented."
---


## Objective
Ensure unauthorized users cannot escalate their privileges or access admin settings, and that all such attempts are logged and denied.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a guest or non-admin account for testing.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus app as a guest or non-admin user.
2. Attempt to access admin settings or perform admin-only actions (e.g., module management, user management).
	- _Screenshot needed: Attempted access to admin settings as a non-admin._
3. Observe the system's response. The action should be denied and logged.
	- _Video recommended: Record the attempt and the system's denial response._
4. If possible, review the system logs or audit trail for the recorded attempt.
	- _Screenshot needed: Log entry or audit trail showing the denied action._

## Expected Results
- Unauthorized actions are blocked and the user is shown an appropriate error message.
- The attempt is logged in the system for auditing.
- If privilege escalation is possible, document the steps and capture screenshots or video.

**Tip:** If you encounter any issues, please document the error message and steps taken, and attach screenshots or a video for troubleshooting.
