## Objective
Verify that an admin user can configure an instance and that the configuration is saved and usable by members and students.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist or be created.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus Vitrine Website App as an admin and go to the home page: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home)
	- _Screenshot needed: Home page with instance list before configuration._
2. After creating a new instance or selecting an existing one, click the **Setup** link in the instance actions menu: [https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.hownee.com/setup/](https://atptestinginstance-papyrus.hownee.com/setup/)
	- _Screenshot needed: Setup page with configuration options._
3. Configure the instance as required (e.g., name, modules, users, theme). Please enter the configuration details you used below:

	```
	[Insert configuration details here]
	```

4. Save the configuration and wait for the system to process the changes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the configuration process and confirmation message._
5. Log in as a member or student and verify that the configured instance is accessible and usable.
	- _Screenshot needed: Member/student view of the configured instance._

## Expected Results
- The instance configuration is saved and members/students can access the instance as expected.
- If configuration fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
