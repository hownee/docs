## Objective
Ensure an admin user can restart an existing instance and verify the restart is successful.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus app as an admin and navigate to the home section with the instances list: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home)
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page before restart._
2. Select the instance you wish to restart. Please specify the instance name below:

	```
	[Insert instance name here]
	```

3. Click the **Restart** button or similar action for the selected instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: Restart confirmation dialog or progress indicator._
4. Wait for the system to process the restart. This may take a few minutes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the restart process and confirmation of completion._
5. Once the system responds, verify that the instance status reflects the restart and that it is accessible.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instance details page after restart._

## Expected Results
- The instance is successfully restarted and remains accessible.
- If the restart fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).

**Tip:** If you encounter any issues, please document the error message and steps taken, and attach screenshots or a video for troubleshooting.
