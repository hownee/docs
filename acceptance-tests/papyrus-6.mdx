## Objective
Ensure an admin user can delete an existing instance and verify the deletion is successful.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus app as an admin and navigate to the home section with the instances list: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home)
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page before deletion._
2. Select the instance you wish to delete. Please specify the instance name below:

	```
	[Insert instance name here]
	```

3. Click the **Delete** button or similar action for the selected instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: Delete confirmation dialog or progress indicator._
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted. Wait for the system to process the deletion. This may take a few minutes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the deletion process and confirmation of completion._
5. Once the system responds, verify that the instance is removed from the list and is no longer accessible.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page after deletion._

## Expected Results
- The instance is successfully deleted and is no longer accessible.
- If the deletion fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
