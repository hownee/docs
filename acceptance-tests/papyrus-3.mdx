## Objective
Ensure an admin user can upgrade an existing instance and verify the update is successful.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus app as an admin and navigate to the home section with the instances list: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/home)
	- _Screenshot needed: Instances list page before upgrade._
2. Select the instance you wish to upgrade. Please specify the instance name below:

	```
	[Insert instance name here]
	```

3. Click the **Upgrade** button or similar action for the selected instance.
	- _Screenshot needed: Upgrade confirmation dialog or progress indicator._
4. Wait for the system to process the upgrade. This may take a few minutes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the upgrade process and confirmation of completion._
5. Once the system responds, verify that the instance status reflects the upgrade and that it is accessible.
	- _Screenshot needed: Instance details page after upgrade._

## Expected Results
- The instance is successfully upgraded and remains accessible.
- Any new features or changes from the upgrade are visible.
- If the upgrade fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
