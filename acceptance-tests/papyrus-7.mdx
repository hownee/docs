title: "Add Modules of an Instance"
description: "Ensure modules can be added or removed from a configured instance."
---


## Objective
Ensure an admin user can add modules to a configured instance and verify that users can access the new modules.

## Prerequisites
- You must have a valid admin account. If you do not have credentials, please request them from your system administrator.
- At least one instance must already exist.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus Vitrine Website App as an admin and go to the modules page: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules)
	- _Screenshot needed: Modules page before adding modules._
2. Click the **Add Module** button or similar action. Select the modules you wish to add. Please specify the modules below:

	```
	[Insert module names here]
	```

3. Confirm and submit the addition. Wait for the system to process the changes.
	- _Video recommended: Record the process of adding modules and the confirmation message._
4. Log in as a standard user and verify that the new modules are accessible in the instance app.
	- _Screenshot needed: User view of the instance app with the new modules visible._

## Expected Results
- The selected modules are added to the instance.
- Standard users can access and use the new modules.
- If the addition fails, an appropriate error message is displayed (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).
