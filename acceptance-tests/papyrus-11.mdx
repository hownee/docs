title: "Check Role-Based Module Access"
description: "Ensure modules are only accessible by authorized roles."
---


## Objective
Ensure modules are only accessible and modifiable by authorized roles, and that role-based access control is enforced.

## Prerequisites
- At least one instance must be created and deployed.
- You must have both admin and member accounts for testing.

## Steps
1. Log in to the Papyrus Vitrine Website App as an admin and go to the modules page: [https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules](https://papyrus.hownee.com/app/modules)
	- _Screenshot needed: Modules page with role configuration options._
2. Configure module access for different roles (e.g., Admin, Member, Guest). Please specify the roles and modules below:

	```
	[Insert roles and module access configuration here]
	```

3. Log in as a member (non-admin) and attempt to access or modify the modules.
	- _Video recommended: Record the member's attempt to access or modify modules._
4. Observe the system's response to unauthorized access attempts.
	- _Screenshot needed: Error or access denied message for unauthorized roles._

## Expected Results
- Only assigned roles can access or modify modules as configured.
- Unauthorized roles are denied access and shown an appropriate message.
- If access control fails, an error message should be documented (please capture a screenshot if this occurs).

**Tip:** If you encounter any issues, please document the error message and steps taken, and attach screenshots or a video for troubleshooting.
